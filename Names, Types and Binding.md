## [Reserved key words](#reserved-key-words)

JavaScript has 39 reserved key words as of ECMA 2015.

| Keyword | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|`await`|The `await` operator is used to wait for a Promise. It can only be used inside an `async` function within regular JavaScript code; however it can be used on its own with JavaScript modules.|
|`break`|The `break` statement terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement.|
|`case`| Refer to `switch` keyword.|
|`catch`| The `try...catch` statement marks a block of statements to try and specifies a response should an exception be thrown.|
|`class`| The `class` declaration creates a new class with a given name using prototype-based inheritance.|
|`const`| Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the `let` keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration). However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.|
|`continue`|The `continue` statement terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.|
|`debugger`|The `debugger` statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.|
|`default`| A `default` clause used in `switch case` block (refer to `switch` key word for more details); if provided, this clause is executed if the value of expression doesn't match any of the case clauses.|
|`delete`|The `delete` operator removes a property from an object; if no more references to the same property are held, it is eventually released automatically.|
|`do`|The `do...while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.|
|`else`|The `if` statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. If the condition is falsy, another statement can be executed. Multiple `if...else` statements can be nested to create an `else if` clause.|
|`enum`\*|The `enum` keyword declares an enumerated type.|
|`export`|The `export` statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export live bindings to functions, objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs with the `import` statement. The value of an imported binding is subject to change in the module that exports it. When a module updates the value of a binding that it exports, the update will be visible in its imported value.|
|`extends`| Declaration of a subclass inheriting another class (the parent/ extended class).|
|`finally`| The statements are used in `try..catch` block, executed after the try statement completes. These statements execute regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught.
|`for`|The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop.|
|`function`|The `function` declaration (function statement) defines a function with the specified parameters.|
|`if`| The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. If the condition is falsy, another statement can be executed. Multiple `if...else` statements can be nested to create an `else if` clause.|
|`import`| The static `import` statement is used to import read only live bindings which are exported by another module.|
|`implements`\*| The implements keyword is used to implement an interface.|
|`in`| The `in` operator returns `true` if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain.|
|`instanceof`| The `instanceof` operator tests to see if the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. The return value is a boolean value.|
|`interface`\*|The `interface` keyword is used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods.|
|`let`|The `let` statement declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.|
|`new`|The `new` operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.
|`package`\*| A `package` is a directory with one or more `module`s inside of it and a `package.json` file wich has metadata about the package.|
|`private`\*|The `private` key word is an access modifier for attributes, methods and constructors, making them visible only inside of the function or module.|
|`protected`\*|The `protected` key word is an access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them visible in the same package and subclasses.|
|`public`\*| The `public` key word is an access modifier for attributes, methods and constructors, making them visible outside the function or module.|
|`return`|The `return` statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.|
|`static`\*|The `static` keyword defines a `static` method for a class.|
|`super`|The `super` keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.|
|`switch`| The `switch` statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a `case` clause, and executes statements associated with that `case`, as well as statements in `case`s that follow the matching `case`.|
|`this`|A property of an execution context (global, function or eval) that, in nonâ€“strict mode, is always a reference to an object and in strict mode can be any value.|
|`throw`|The `throw` statement throws a user-defined exception. Execution of the current function will stop (the statements after `throw` won't be executed), and control will be passed to the first `catch` block in the call stack.|
|`try`|The `try...catch` statement marks a block of statements to try and specifies a response should an exception be thrown.|
|`typeof`|The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.|
|`var`|The `var` statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.|
|`void`|The `void` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns `undefined`.|
|`while`|The `while` statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.|
|`with`|The `with` statement extends the scope chain for a statement.|
|`yield`|The `yield` keyword is used to pause and resume a generator function.|

 *\* They are reserved as future keywords by the ECMAScript specification. They have no special functionality at present, but they might at some future time, so they cannot be used as identifiers.*

## [Naming requirements for variables](#naming-requirements-for-variables)

- Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a small number of cases noted below, underscores (`_`) and very rarely (when required by frameworks like Angular) dollar signs (`$`). All names start with a letter.
- Package names are all lowerCamelCase.
- Class, interface, record, and typedef names are written in UpperCamelCase. Type names are typically nouns or noun phrases.
- Method names are written in lowerCamelCase. Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases.
- Enum names are written in UpperCamelCase, similar to classes, and should generally be singular nouns. Individual items within the enum are named in CONSTANT_CASE.
- Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores.
- Local variable names are written in lowerCamelCase, except for module-local (top-level) constants, as described above. Constants in function scopes are still named in lowerCamelCase
- Parameter names are written in lowerCamelCase. When required by a third-party framework, parameter names may begin with a `$`.

Please refer to [data-type.js](https://github.com/anh-nguyen-98/introduction-to-javascript/blob/main/data-type.js).

These naming conventions are enforeced by standards in the community.

## [Typing](#typing)

- JavaScript is dynamically typed.

For example,

```javascript
let foo = 42;    // foo is now a number
foo     = 'bar'; // foo is now a string
foo     = true;  // foo is now a boolean
```

- JavaScript is weakly typed.
For example,

```javascript
var total= 6.51;
var message = "Your total is $";
var deliver = message + total + ".";
console.log(deliver) // output: "Your total is $6.51."

```

- JavaScript is both implicitly typed and explicitly typed depending on the values.

## [Mutability](#mutability)

- All JavaScript primitive types define immutable values. Primitive types include:
    * Boolean
    * Null
    * Undefined
    * Number
    * BigInt
    * String
    * Symbol
- Objects define mutable values.
    * Date
    * Array
    * Set
    * Map

## [Operators](#operators)

### [Assignment operators](#assignment-operators)

- list operators
- structuring & destructuring 
- discourage chaining
   - example

### [Comparison operators](#comparison-operators)
- list
- pay attention to strict equal `===` vs. `==`

### [Arithmetic operators](#arithmetic-operators)
- list
- integer division or float devision?
- division by 0 --> infinity

### [Bitwise operators](#bitwise-operators)

### [Logical operators](#logical-operators)

- list
- short-circuit

### [String operator](#string-operator)

### [Ternary (conditional) operator](#ternary-(-conditional-)-operator)

### [Comma operator](#comma-operator)

### [Unary operator](#unary-operator)

- delete
- typeof
- void

### [Relational operator](#relational-operator)

- in 
- in vs. of


*6. Are mixed type operations allowed? If so, how are they accommodated?*

*7. At what point are identifier names and operator symbols bound in your language? For example if you declare a (variable, class name, function name), when is it bound to the type, address? When are operators (+,*, etc.) bound to their operations?*

*8. Describe the limitations (or lack thereof) of your programming language as they relate to the coding example portion of the assignment (adding ints and floats, storing different types in lists, converting between data types). Are there other restrictions or pitfalls that the documentation mentions that you need to be aware of?*

*9. Are there built-in complex data types that are commonly used in your language? (hint: theyâ€™d probably appear fairly early in the documentation if so)*
