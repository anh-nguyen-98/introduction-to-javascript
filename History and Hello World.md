# Javascript: History and Hello World

## [History](#history)

## [Getting started](#getting-started)

### [Installation](#installation)
 
Follow these steps to install JavaScript to your machine:

1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to your machine.

**Nodejs** is a JavaScript runtime environment that helps executes your Javascript code outside the web browser (i.e. the IDE on your machine).  

2. Check whether Node.js has been successfully installed on your computer by openning Terminal on your computer (or Command Prompt/ Powershell on Windows) typing `node -v`.

The terminal should display the Node.js version installed on your computer. 

### Programming Environment


### [Running JavaScript](#running-javascript)

1. Open your favorite IDE. 

My favorite one is Visual Studio Code (VSC). You can download (VSC)(https://code.visualstudio.com/download). VSC comes with many great JavaScript extensions such as JavaScript IntelliSense for debugging, formatting,...

2. Create a new file with `<filename>.js` extension. 
3. Write your JavaScript script (e.g. `console.log ("Hello World")`)
4. Open Terminal on your IDE. For example, on VSC, you go `View > Terminal`. 
5. In Terminal, change directory to the folder containing your `.js` file.
6. Type `node <filename>.js` and press Enter.
