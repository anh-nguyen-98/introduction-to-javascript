# Javascript: History and Hello World

## [History](#history)

## [Getting started](#getting-started)

### [Installation](#installation)
 
Follow these steps to install JavaScript to your machine:

1. Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en).

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime environment that helps executes your Javascript code outside the web browser (i.e. the IDE on your machine).

2. Install Node.js on your machine by:
    2.1. Open the downloaded package (installer). The Node.js Setup Wizard shows up.
    2.2. Keep clicking **Next** if you agree to the default configuration settings.
    2.3. Finally, click **Install**.
    2.4. When the installer finished, click **Finish**.

3. Check whether Node.js has been successfully installed on your computer by:
    
    3.1. Open `Terminal` on your computer (or `Command Prompt`/ `Powershell` on Windows).
 
    3.2. Run `node -v`.

The terminal should display the Node.js version installed on your computer.

### [Programming Environment](programming-environment)

JavaScript does not come with a specific recommended programming environment. However, you can write and run JavaScript on many IDEs. Some popular choices are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

### [Running JavaScript](#running-javascript)

1. Open your favorite IDE. 

My favorite one is Visual Studio Code (VSC). You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). VSC comes with many great JavaScript extensions such as *JavaScript IntelliSense* for debugging, formatting, autocompletion, etc.

2. Create a new file with `<filename>.js` extension (e.g. `helloworld.js`). 
3. Write your JavaScript script (e.g. `console.log ("Hello World")`)
4. Open Terminal on your IDE. For example, on VSC, you go `View > Terminal`. 
5. In Terminal, change directory to the folder containing your `<filename>.js` file.
6. Type `node <filename>.js` and press Enter.
