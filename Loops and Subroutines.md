# Loops and Subtoutines

* Write (or try to emulate, if your language doesnâ€™t have them) different kinds of loops: while, do/while, for, foreach
* Write a function that takes in two numbers, multiplies them, and returns the output
* Write a recursive function (one that calculates a factorial is fine)
* Write a function that takes in a string (or your language's equivalent) and splits it into two strings, then returns both strings
* Call your functions and save the results of the function calls in variables.
* Write a function that tests whether your language is pass-by-reference or pass-by-value.

1. Does your language include multiple types of loops (while, do/while, for, foreach)? If so, what are they and how do they differ from each other?

2. What is the syntax for declaring a function in your language?
3. Are there any rules about where the function has to be placed in your code file so that it can run?
4. Does your language support recursive functions?
5. Can functions in your language accept multiple parameters? Can they be of different data types?
6. Can functions in your language return multiple values at the same time? How is that implemented?  If not, are there ways around that problem?  What are they?
7. Is your language pass-by reference or value? Check your code against outside sources in case there is anything tricky going on (like in Perl).
8. Are there any other aspects of functions in your language that aren't specifically asked about here, but that are important to know in order to write one? What are they?
